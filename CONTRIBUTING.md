## Community

It's the early days of Phase and we're working hard to build an awesome, inclusive community. In order to grow this, all community members must adhere to our Code of conduct.

## Bugs and issues

Bug reports help make Phase a better experience for everyone. When you report a bug, a template will be created automatically containing information we'd like to know.

Before raising a new issue, please search existing ones to make sure you're not creating a duplicate.

**If the issue is related to security, please email us directly at security@phase.dev**

## Deciding what to work on

You can start by browsing through our list of issues or adding your own that improves on the platform experience. Once you've decided on an issue, leave a comment and wait to get approved; this helps avoid multiple people working on the same issue.

If you're ever in doubt about whether or not a proposed feature aligns with Phase as a whole, feel free to raise an issue about it and we'll get back to you promptly.

## Writing and submitting code

Anyone can contribute code to Phase. To get started, check out the local development guide, make your changes, and submit a pull request to the main repository.

## Licensing

Most of Phase's code is under the MIT license, though some paid feature restrictions are covered by a proprietary license.
