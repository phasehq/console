## Reporting vulnerabilities

Please do not file GitHub issues or post on our public forum for security vulnerabilities, as they are public!

Phase takes security issues very seriously. If you have any concerns about Phase or believe you have uncovered a vulnerability, please get in touch via the e-mail address `security@phase.dev`. In the message, try to provide a description of the issue and ideally a way of reproducing it. The security team will get back to you as soon as possible.
